## Minimalistic rEFInd theme [DARK]

This is a fork of https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal theme.

[rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is an easy to use boot manager for UEFI
based systems.

### Usage

 1. Locate your refind EFI directory. This is commonly `/boot/EFI/refind`
    though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is
    installed. `fdisk -l` and `mount` may help.

 2. Create a folder called `themes` inside it, if it doesn't already exist

 3. Clone this repository into the `themes` directory.

 4. To enable the theme add `include themes/rEFInd-minimal/theme.conf` at the end of
    `refind.conf`.

Entries that are autodetected should also show the proper icons.

### Background sizes

If you find the background looks blurry it may be due to the included wallpaper
being an incorrect resolution for your monitor. You can download the [original
high quality wallpaper][wallpaper], resize it as appropriate, and replace the
`background.png`.

You can of course also choose your own background!
